# `milk` CURRENT PROJECT SCOPE COLLABORATION BETWEEN KEYMATE.AI AND USER: 'b0ttle' - deadcoast.net - deadcoast  
**COMMANDS,TRIGGERS,VARIABLES TYPED IN CLI SHOULD INIT THE SCRIPT USING REGULAR EXPRESSION:**

### LEGEND AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION, 

**`TECHNICAL` EXPLANATION FORMAT**= [COMMAND]{TRIGGER}(VARIABLE)
1. [COMMAND] IS DYNAMIC refers to the milk command, which is integral to the CLI.
2. {TRIGGER} IS DYNAMIC refers to specific actions, like sour or man, handled by separate modules within the triggers/ directory. These are the sub-commands that milk will call upon.
3. (VARIABLE) IS DYNAMIC and is used to describe parameters or options that can be passed to {TRIGGER} to modify their behavior. These are implemented in separate modules within the variables/ directory and can be used across different {TRIGGER} modules.

### `milk` CLI [COMMAND] INTRO AND EXPLANATIONS.

1. **`milk`** - A DYNAMICALLY DESIGNED CLI MAIN HUB MODULE. 
    1. INTRO TO [`milk`] THIS MODULE IS DESIGNED TO DYNAMICALLY OPERATE WITH ITS CORRESPONDING MODULES. 
        1. THE MODULES SHOULD CALL UPON INFORMATION IN EACH-OTHERS FUNCTIONAL {TRIGGERS}, (VARIABLES).
        2. `milk` REPRESENTS THE MAIN INIT AND EXECUTION [COMMAND].
        3. TECHNICAL EXAMPLE USED IN PIP= [`pip {install} (black)`]
		4. REAL WORLD EXAMPLE USED IN PIP "pip install black"
		5. THE `milk` CLI TECHNICAL EQUIVALENT= [`milk {TRIGGER} (~variable)`]
		6. USE IN A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE `milk sour ~help` 
	2. `milk` "CALL_CHARACTERS" ARE EXECUTION CALLS TO A {TRIGGER} OR (VARIABLE) SEE EXAMPLES BELOW: 
	    1. `~` - THE MAIN TRIGGER  CALL CHARACTER FOR `milk` CLI AND ITS CORE COMMANDS.
            1. `~` DESIGNATES AN EXECUTION OF A (VARIABLE)
			2. `~` ONLY USED ON (VARIABLES) CALLS. 
        2. `+` - "ADD" FUNCTION CALL TO CREATE PLACEHOLDER FOR {TRIGGER} AND (VARIABLE).  
		    1. `+` SIGN TO OPERATE AS AN "ADD" COMMAND EXECUTION.
		    2. `+` WILL ACT AS A MODULE TO CREATE A NEW {TRIGGER} OR (VARIABLE) 
		    3. `+` SHOULD ALWAYS TRIGGER A PROMPT BACK FROM THE CLI FOR THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO CREATE THE PLACEHOLDER AND TODO.
            4. `+` KEEPS THE CLI COMMANDS SHORT, OPTIMIZED, MANAGEABLE. 
2. **(VARIABLE)** - A MODULE DESIGN TO WORK DYNAMICALLY TO MAXIMIZE USER QUALITY OF LIFE.
	1. THE (VARIABLES) SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT AND WORK ACROSS ALL {TRIGGER}. (VARIABLES) ARE DESIGNED TO BE MODULAR AND DYNAMIC.
		1. `(core_commands_list= '~mom', '~list')` THESE COMMANDS WOULD DYNAMICALLY PRODUCE THE AVAILABLE COMMANDS LIST IN THAT TRIGGER.
		2. `(help_this_trigger= '~h', '~help')` THESE VARIABLES WILL BE USED ACROSS THE `milk` CLI TRIGGERS TO PRODUCE HELP IN THAT SECTION. A MODULATED HELP COMMAND.   
		3. `(path_me= '~?', '~path')` THESE VARIABLES PRINT THE CLI CURRENT DIRECTORY.
		4. `(milk_nav_back= '~back')` THIS WILL CANCEL ANY OPERATION AND BRING THE USER BACK TO THE PREVIOUS MENU. USEFUL FOR ANY MULTI RESPONSE ENGAGEMENTS SUCH AS "+"
		    1. IF ERROR PRINT= ERROR CONTROL
		5. `(milk_nav_back= '~back')`
3. **`sour`** - A DYNAMIC, MODULATED DESIGN FOR CORRESPONDING REPAIR SCRIPTS AND COMMANDS.
    1. `sour` IS A `milk` COMMAND TRIGGER THAT IDENTIFIES REPAIR. 
    2. `sour` {TRIGGER} MODULE INTRODUCES FUNCTIONS TO REPAIR THINGS SUCH AS; VENV, INTERPRETERS AND DEPENDENCIES, EXAMPLES:
        1. TECHNICAL EXPLANATION= `milk {sour} (~variable)` 
		2. REAL WORLD USE= `milk sour ~venv`
		3. THIS SHOULD TRIGGER A CONFIRMATION AND OR ERROR PROMPT BACK FROM `milk` CLI 'THE MILK HAS `SOWERED`'
4. **`man`** - A UNIQUELY DESIGNED MODULAR TOOL TO STREAMLINE COMMAND CREATION IN THE CLI.
    1. RUNS ON SEPARATE INDEPENDENT MODULE (VARIABLES) THAT CAN INTERACT WITH EACH-OTHER AS SEPARATE FILES. 
	    1. DESIGNED TO OPERATE SO ONLY ONE SUBPROCESS OF `man` IS RUNNING AT A TIME.
        2. THE `man` {TRIGGER} WILL INTERACT WITH ITS CORRESPONDING (VARIABLE) IF CALLED. 
		3. IF NO (VARIABLE) CALLED= ERROR CONTROL PROMPT
		4. IF INCORRECT VARIABLE CALLED= ERROR CONTROL PROMPT
    2. `man` execution variables and examples
        1. TECHNICAL BREAKDOWN= `[milk] {'man'} (~variable)`
		2. REAL WORLD USE EXAMPLE= `milk man ~list`
        3. Assuming their was a correlating (VARIABLE) in place for the {TRIGGER} `milk man ~list`, [`milk`] CLI would print the ~list (VARIABLE) for the `man` {TRIGGER}
